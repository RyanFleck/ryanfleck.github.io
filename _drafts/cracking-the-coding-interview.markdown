I read this awful book, a tome which characterises all the worst elements of the technology industry, so you don't have to. Included is a short summary of each chapter and my takeaways.

# Chapter Summaries

The **foreword** states that interviews are hard. Your primary focus should be applying your skills and intuition to a problem. Solving the problem is of less importance than your technical process.

Following this, the **introduction** outlines a scenario where a highly qualified friend was turned down for a job at Google. His academic programming skills were sublime, but *K&R* and *CLRS* were not enough to prepare him for interviews, despite the theory being incredibly valuable once *on the job.* Real interview questions focus on developing 'fresh' algorithms rather than memorizing existing problems.

## The Interview Process

Algorithms and programming problems are the largest component of a tech interview; the interviewer is attempting to evaluate your ability to solve unfamiliar problems. It is essential to vocalize your thought process. The method by which you analyse, propose a solution, judge tradeoffs, and implement a solution to a problem will be compared to others who have been interviewed.

Academic knowledge of data structures and algorithms is useful. It is hard to formulate problem-solving questions that don't involve a data structure.
