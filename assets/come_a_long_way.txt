Come a Long Way

          G           Em           D7         G                                                              
Oh, we've come a long way since we last shook hands
C           D           Em 
Still got a long way to go
   Am                               D7 
We couldn't see the flowers when we last shook hands
G                Em         D7             G
Couldn't see the flowers on account of the snow

D  G 

What did you do with your burden & your cross
Did you carry it yourself or did you crack
You & I know that a burden & a cross
Can only be carried on one man's back

All my life I wanted to roam
To go to the ends of the earth
But the earth really ends where you started to roam
Cause you & I know what a circle is worth

Lets drink a cup to what went down
There's not much left to reveal
I think I changed my mind after what went down
As to who in the end got the better deal

Give me your hand for the parting touch
Fare thee well & thanks a lot
I know that we promised that we'd keep in touch
But you & I know that we both forgot

Repeat 1st verse twice
