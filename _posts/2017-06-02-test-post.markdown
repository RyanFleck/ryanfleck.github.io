So, this is probably the third time I've deleted this repository and put a new one up.

It looks like I've cracked the initial jekyll formula- now for customization!

Let's test these code snippets:

```python
if(jekyll == "Awesome"):
    print("I agree, static websites are great.")
```

### **TEST:** Titles
# H1 Title!
## H2 Title!
### H3 Title!
#### H4 Title!
##### H5 Title!
###### H6 Title!

### **TEST:** Lists:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/art/s.png" alt="RCF" style="border-radius:0; width: 289px;"/>
