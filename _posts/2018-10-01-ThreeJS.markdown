Demo live at [experiments/cubefield](https://ryanfleck.github.io/experiments/cubefield).

Tinkering with Three.JS has been neat. This demo utilizes tilt input on mobile devices, and the cursor position on desktop.

Data like this is displayed on the left:

```
Running rcf039 three.js experiment: CUBEFIELD
Testing ENABLED f21502 mouse
Input Screen Location: 260,10
Input Screen Ratio: 0.2714,0.01531
Input Velocity Delta: -7,-17

Active key keycodes: 65, 68, 70, 73

Gyroscopic Sensor Output: false
	Alpha x: 0
	Beta  y: 0
	Gamma z: 0
```

These are all polled at different rates. Near source in projects repo. <https://github.com/RyanFleck/Projects/blob/master/js/rcf037_Three05.js>
