I generally refrain from writing any politically contentious material, but the *agents of social change* festering within my city and university campus can no longer be safely ignored without permanent regressions in our progressive, modern country. I have included the full text of my references to ensure the source material does not change and the arguments remain cogent, including dictionary definitions and the entirety of [M-103](#full-text-of-motion-103).

**Racist** has lost all meaning within the discourse of modern liberal societies. The word previously had monumental power; it is not an invitation to conversation, but an allegation where those who stand accused must immediately prove their innocence. The word retains this serious stature in the mainstream only through feigned shock, as it is currently used to describe some of the *least racist people on earth*, in countries who are currently the most accommodating and thoughtful about their interaction with other societies.

Undoubtedly the most racist people in our society are those socialists who champion diversity; by speaking on behalf of *people of color*, these "freedom fighters" do an incredible disservice by stripping people of their autonomy and power.

By placing a heavy focus on an individuals' tribe, personal traits are rendered meaningless. Without placing value on personal accomplishment, people will not work hard to reach goals because there is *no reason to*. This system is essentially the textbook definition of *Fascism*[^2].

> **Fascism:** A political philosophy, movement, or regime that **exalts nation and often race above the individual** and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition. ([MW](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism))

If society as a whole does not revert to valuing its citizens as a collection of individuals, rather than a battleground of races competing for reparations, our society will surely devolve into a Neo-Fascist regime. *Socialism always fails.*

**May your personal accomplishments define you,**

## Newspeak Glossary

The following words and phrases make up the newspeak of the current liberal media and establishment, which worryingly trend towards Globalism and Socialism, neither of which are healthy for maintaining a *good* and productive society. These include:

* **Equality:** Newspeak that also suggests *social equity*, or equality of outcome. This tends to be dangerous as it nullifies the benefits of working hard and places a greater focus on immutable personal characteristics, usually race or gender.
* **White People:** Defining all *white people* as a homogeneous group does an incredible disservice to the diverse groups therein. Hispanics, as their skin tone is literally above a certain tone threshold, are often lumped into this identity group.
* **People of Color:** Defining all *non-white people* as a homogeneous group does an incredible disservice to the diverse groups therein. Unsettlingly similar to the currently racist term *Colored People*. Previously *minorities*.
* **Micro-XYZ:** Micro-aggressions, micro-invalidation, micro-assaults, *macro-garbage!* Words used by people unwilling to provide a comprehensible system of logic to back their thoughts and opinions and unable to handle contention between ideas.
* **Diversity:** Newspeak for including members of a multitude of cultures, who are explicitly not white in literal color, ignoring the qualifications and accomplishments of individuals. *Diversity* does a disservice to accomplished women and men of all stripes who have worked hard to become well-learned and skilled in their field.
* **Privilege:** Anti-white racism and identity politics at its finest: *Explicity* does not apply to *people of color*. Privilege is generally defined by the far left as the inherent advantages of being a member of the racial majority.
* **Institutional Racism:** A vague cry for reparations; while people have absolutely been targeted in the past by corporations for their skin color, creating artificial divisions in society, there are not many truly *racist* institutions operating today. Simply stating that an institution is racist, without evidence, is reprehensible.
* **Islamophobia:** People have a right to be scared of a society which brings with it *Hamas* and *Hezbollah*, *Sharia*, and rampant anti-female and antisemite rhetoric. Motion 103 ([read it here](http://www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Iqra-Khalid(88849)/Motions)) is essentially a precursor to *blasphemy laws*, defined as *"the act or offense of speaking sacrilegiously about God or sacred things; profane talk.[^1]"*
* **Feminism:** Special additional privileges for women. Previously a noble and important movement for legal parity between both genders. Feminism is still very important outside of North America and Europe, where women do not have legal parity with men.
* **Fascist:** Commonly used to refer to white, conservative men who could not be further from literal fascists. Alternatively, *someone who refuses to revert to tribalism.*
* **Inclusive:** Having respect for people based on their physical qualities, especially skin color, but *is not objectification.*
