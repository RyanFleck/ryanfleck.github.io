This post is *mostly* going to be markdown tests, along with some thoughts on my future career moves and how I'm going to deal with my persistent brain fog. I really want to see how headers and code work with different css colors and page fonts.

I'll be using [this](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/) markdown quick reference, along with other sites. There are included at the bottom of this post.[^1]

So, this should look like code: 'this is code. print("test")'

This is python in a block:
```python
print("Hello, Github.")
```
This is ruby in a block:
```ruby
puts "Hello, Github."
```
This is java in a block:
```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Github.");
}}
```

# BIG TITLE
###### little title

A title
:A name given to a body of work, which often descibes the content.

This should expand as an abbreviation: [GNU]: Gnu's not Unix.
