I enjoy making games much more than playing them these days. As I want to start making games and experiences *for other people*,  I have decided to utilize the web and modern JavaScript to deliver trinkets. Current proto-demo for *Brutal Ice* at [experiments/brutal-ice](https://ryanfleck.github.io/experiments/brutal-ice/). (Do not open on mobile.)

Source code and experiment explanation at <https://github.com/RyanFleck/Brutal-Ice>.

Will be doing this as a hobby going forward.

### Update 2018-11-16

Finally got the spritesheet into reasonable shape. I had forgotten to grab a few sprites from the game, so when I *did* get the animations working initially, the player looked quite broken.

Animations are minimal but look good and can be tested now.

### Update 2018-11-17

Collisions implemented. NPC now present to bump.
