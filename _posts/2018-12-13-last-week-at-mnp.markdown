**Twelve months.** Twelve months I've spent with two teams, four projects, heaps of technology, friends, mentors, deadlines, crunch time, rewards, comradery and clients. The kid who shakily agreed to a tech consulting internship a year ago might not recognize me today; the chip buffed out of my shoulder, gaze steady, speech thoughtful and clear. I've been given direction and seen progress. I have my fantastic colleagues and managers to thank for this.

So, what exactly did I do this year?
1. **January -> July** - QA, CMS Development for a Canadian hospital specializing in mental health.
1. **July -> August** - According to my journal, I only struggled with a preprocessor written in PHP?
1. **September -> October** - QA for an extension to the CMS for a Canadian bank.
1. **October -> November** - Development to extend the CMS for a Canadian airline.
1. **November** - Had the pleasure of attending MNP's Consulting Bootcamp in Toronto.
1. **November -> December** - Airline CMS + Work on AEM prototype for client bid.

I sent my coworkers this note:

<br />

Hello MNP Kanata,

During the past twelve months, I have spoken attentively with each of you, and been rewarded with a heap of valuable lessons.
Your guidance has enabled me to take a confident first step into this competitive and rewarding industry.
I enter my next two years of University a far more resourceful, socially intelligent, competent kid.

I can’t thank you all enough for this.
