So, I've taken a brief trip to Calgary. I’ve been casually going through this amazing book, allegedly the bible of C programming: ‘The C Programming Language (2ed, Kernighan/Ritchie).’ It’s been a decent read, and C is a personal favourite of mine, not because I know it well in any way, but because of what it has been used to build in the past, namely all the Unix-y underpinnings of today's software world.

At the suggestion of a good friend, I’ve also considered investing a bit of time in COBOL, which I previously dismissed as an antiquated, dried-up language of yesterday. He made quite the case for it- COBOL is allegedly still used in 80+% of the world’s business data processing applications, and many of the programmers who originally wrote and maintained the code are retiring or moving up to management. In his words, *“You can make a ton of money programming in COBOL because banks still use it for everything.”* After some light research, I totally agree. Erik, if you’re reading this, contact me on github, we can learn together.

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID.  TinyProgram.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
DisplayGreeting.
   DISPLAY "Hello, world!".
   STOP RUN.

```
It's quite funny how english-like COBOL is. Line endings are periods rather than semicolons.I expected much worse. Guess I gotta challenge all my other preconceived notions regarding programming now.




Thanks for reading.
