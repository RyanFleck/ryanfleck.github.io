It's approaching 3AM. Today I've managed to learn:

- Very basic HTML and CSS.
- Basic Ruby and Jekyll.
- I've been making coffee wrong.

Over the past five hours, I've assembled and disassembled this page you're reading several times. I couldn't seem to get the page to do everything I wanted. Luckily, the documentation for Jekyll is clear and well-written, and setting up the default layout the way I liked it was pretty easy.

Colors are still a problem- currently, the page is composed entirely of black text on a white background. I was experimenting with a neat, washed-out palette with muted reds and greens, but couldn't seem to reset the color of the links. Ended up taking a scorched-earth approach.

Watched 'Sound City' while I was working. 7/10. If you're a foo fighters fan it's a must-watch.

Tomorrow I gotta learn to use my french press properly- I got some neat new beans, but I think my water may have been too hot as the coffee came out unpleasantly bitter and dry. Might've just been the beans.

I'm going to spend a few hours tomorrow putting more time into my LibGDX project: I really see potential in the api, and think I'll be able to get basic unit selection and map panning/zooming implemented.

Until tomorrow,
