![Soldiers on the move!]({{ site.url }}/assets/BetaGameLarge.png)

In my few hours with the library, LibGDX has impressed me in a number of small ways. The installlation was hassle-free with gradle, and so far documentation has been very easy to find, both official and unnoficial.

I appreciate the simple yet powerful workflow:
```java
@Override
public void render () {
	queryInput();
	adjustVariables();
	drawGraphics();
}
```
This post was created primarily as an image-display test. Hopefully you see an image of the game above: a few soldiers running around a test map, sparsely populated with rocks and cacti, essentially barren.

As this game is developed, I'll post updates here. If development becomes serious, it'll get it's own website.
