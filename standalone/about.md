### Contact

My ProtonMail inbox, [ryan.fleck@protonmail.com](mailto:ryan.fleck@protonmail.com),  is the most reliable way to get in touch. I check this inbox twice a day. At those times, I will read all of the messages and pencil in a future time to respond to the most important. At one point, I monitored LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook for Business, Slack and a medley of messengers; this proved to be overwhelming.

I am inaccessible on Sundays.
